# Forecasting-Trajectory-of-Double-Pendulum
recurrent neural network based project

I worked on a similar project where we tried to extrapolate the position of the bob of a double pendulum based on the factors like its initial position, lengths of the rods. We used RNN and trained it with the initial positions and used it to extrapolate whether the double pendulum system is going to achieve the desired point. We tried and tested different double pendulum parameters to obtain the optical system to achieve the desired position.
We used the same technique on the forecasting of the projectile trajectory. We used the initial position of projectile particles, their initial velocity, angle of launch to the RNN and trained it. As a result of the project, we were able to tell just by adding the values of initial features whether the particle is going to be a particular point or not.
